Report on Collections in C# and .NET: A Comparison of Structure, Time Complexity, and Business Case

1. ArrayList (Non-Generic)

Structure:
- ArrayList is a non-generic collection in C#.
- It stores objects of any type and requires casting when retrieving elements.
- Internally, it uses a dynamically resizing array, meaning that its capacity grows as elements are added.

Time Complexity:
- Access by Index: O(1) (Direct array access).
- Insert at the End: O(1) (Amortized, though resizing the internal array can be O(n)).
- Insert/Remove at Index: O(n) (Due to shifting elements).
- Search: O(n) (Linear search).

 **Business Case:**
- Used in legacy code where type safety isn't critical, or backward compatibility with .NET 1.0/1.1 is needed.
- **Example:**
  ```csharp
  ArrayList arrayList = new ArrayList();
  arrayList.Add(1);
  arrayList.Add("Hello");
  object item = arrayList[0]; // Casting may be required

 2. **ArrayList<T>** (Generic)

`ArrayList<T>` is not available in C#. However, the generic equivalent is `List<T>`, which is discussed below.

 3. **List<T>** (Generic)

 **Structure:**
- `List<T>` is a strongly typed generic collection based on an array.
- It can store elements of a specified type, ensuring type safety.
- It dynamically resizes when adding elements beyond the current capacity.

 **Time Complexity:**
- **Access by Index:** O(1) (Direct array access).
- **Insert at the End:** O(1) (Amortized).
- **Insert/Remove at Index:** O(n) (Shifting of elements).
- **Search:** O(n) (Linear search for non-indexed access).

 **Business Case:**
- Ideal for scenarios requiring fast access by index, such as processing items in bulk, building dynamic arrays, or working with strongly typed data.
- **Example:**
  ```csharp
  List<int> list = new List<int>();
  list.Add(10);
  list.Add(20);
  int item = list[0]; // No casting required

 4. **List Methods**

 **Common Methods:**
- **Add:** Adds an element at the end.
- **Remove:** Removes the first occurrence of a specified element.
- **Insert:** Inserts an element at a specified index.
- **IndexOf:** Returns the index of a specified element.
- **Contains:** Checks if the list contains a specific item.

 **Time Complexity for Methods:**
- **Add:** O(1) (Amortized).
- **Remove:** O(n) (Requires search + shifting).
- **Insert:** O(n) (Due to shifting).
- **IndexOf:** O(n) (Linear search).

 **Business Case:**
- Use these methods in dynamic operations involving lists of known types, like managing UI elements or processing data from databases.

 5. **LinkedList<T>** (Generic)

 **Structure:**
- `LinkedList<T>` is a doubly linked list that stores nodes containing references to the next and previous nodes.
- Each element (node) knows its neighbors, making certain operations like insertion or deletion more efficient compared to `List<T>`.

 **Time Complexity:**
- **Access by Index:** O(n) (No direct index access, requires traversal).
- **Insert/Remove at Head/Tail:** O(1).
- **Insert/Remove at Specific Node:** O(1) (Given a reference to the node).
- **Search:** O(n).

 **Business Case:**
- Suitable for scenarios where frequent insertions and deletions are required without caring about random access (e.g., implementing queues, undo/redo functionality).
- **Example:**
  ```csharp
  LinkedList<int> linkedList = new LinkedList<int>();
  linkedList.AddLast(1);
  linkedList.AddFirst(0);
  ```

- 6. **Stack<T>** (Generic)

 **Structure:**
- `Stack<T>` is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) collection, meaning elements are added to the top and removed from the top.
- It's internally implemented as an array that resizes when necessary.

 **Time Complexity:**
- **Push (Add to Top):** O(1).
- **Pop (Remove from Top):** O(1).
- **Peek (Access Top):** O(1).
- **Search:** O(n) (Requires linear traversal).

 **Business Case:**
- Commonly used for scenarios like expression evaluation, reversing elements, and managing function call stacks.
- **Example:**
  ```csharp
  Stack<int> stack = new Stack<int>();
  stack.Push(1);
  stack.Push(2);
  int top = stack.Peek(); // 2
 

---

 7. **Queue<T>** (Generic)

 **Structure:**
- `Queue<T>` is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) collection, where elements are added at the end (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue).
- Internally, it uses a circular array to manage its elements.

 **Time Complexity:**
- **Enqueue (Add to End):** O(1).
- **Dequeue (Remove from Front):** O(1).
- **Peek (Access Front):** O(1).
- **Search:** O(n).

 **Business Case:**
- Useful for scenarios where elements must be processed in the order they are received, like scheduling tasks or managing printer queues.
- **Example:**
  ```csharp
  Queue<int> queue = new Queue<int>();
  queue.Enqueue(1);
  queue.Enqueue(2);
  int front = queue.Dequeue(); // 1
